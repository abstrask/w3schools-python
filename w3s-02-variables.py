# Creating variables

x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)

x = 4 # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)


# Rules for Python variables:
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
# Remember that variables are case-sensitive


# Output

x = "awesome"
print("Python is " + x)

x = "Python is "
y = "awesome"
z =  x + y
print(z)

x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)

x = 5
y = "John"
print(x + y) # cannot combine string and number
